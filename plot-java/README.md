# mstplot-java

**mstplot-java** is a re-write of the mstplot tool in Java.

This project is for visualizing the minimum spanning trees generated by 'mst'.
It is a simple program to generate a PNG image of a graph.  The input data to
'mstplot' is the output data from 'mst --csv'.  A graph is a set of edges.
An edge is a pair of vertices and a weight.


## File format

Each line describes an edge of two points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and
a weight (float).  One edge per line.

```
x1\ty1\tx2\ty2\twt\n
```

## Build

<code>ant jar</code> to build build the jar, <code>mstplot</code> to
run it on the data files, <code>ant doc</code> to run <em>javadoc</em> on
the source files, and <code>ant clean</code> to remove generated files.

To Do
-----
* Figure out why graph-010 has a point off the graph.
* Add "doc" target
