This project is an example implementations of Prim's algorithm for finding
a minimum spanning tree of a completely connected, undirected graph.  The
graph is a set of points where there is an edge from every vertex to every
other vertex.  The goals is to find a set of edges that connect all points
with minimum length of the resulting edges.  Weights for each edge is
distance between vertices.

The 'data' directory contains files with sets of points.  Each line describes
a single point in the form of an x-value, a tab character, and a y-value.
